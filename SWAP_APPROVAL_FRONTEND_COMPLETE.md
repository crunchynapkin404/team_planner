**Example Flow:**
```
Level 1 (✓ Approved) → Level 2 (Active) → Level 3 (Pending)
John Doe              Jane Smith         Mike Johnson
Oct 2, 14:30
```

### Audit Trail

  requires_levels: 1,
  auto_approve_enabled: true,
  auto_approve_max_advance_hours: 24,
});

// Get pending approvals
const approvals = await swapApprovalService.getPendingApprovals();

// Approve swap
await swapApprovalService.approveSwap(swapId, {
  comments: "Approved for emergency coverage"
});

// Reject swap
await swapApprovalService.rejectSwap(swapId, {
  reason: "Insufficient coverage on target date"
});

// Get audit trail
const trail = await swapApprovalService.getAuditTrail(swapId);
```

### Creating Custom Approval Rule

```typescript
const customRule = {
  name: "Weekend Swap Rule",
  description: "Special rules for weekend swaps",
  priority: 150,
  is_active: true,
  applies_to_shift_types: ["incident", "incidents_standby"],
  requires_levels: 3, // Requires 3 approvals
  auto_approve_enabled: false, // Manual approval only
  max_swaps_per_month_per_employee: 2, // Limit to 2 per month
};

await swapApprovalService.createApprovalRule(customRule);
```
