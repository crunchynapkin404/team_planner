## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Conflict

**Setup**:
- Employee A requests Jan 15-20
- Employee B requests Jan 15-20 (same team)

**Expected**:
- Employee B sees conflict warning
- Shows "team conflict" chip
- Alternative dates suggested
- Manager sees conflict on dashboard
- AI recommends based on seniority/first request

### Scenario 2: Understaffing

**Setup**:
- Team has 5 members
- 3 members already on leave Jan 15
- Employee D requests Jan 15-17

**Expected**:
- Warning about understaffing
- Staffing analysis shows shortage
- Alternative dates avoid understaffed days
- Manager sees understaffed days list

### Scenario 3: Shift Conflict

**Setup**:
- Employee E has shift on Jan 15
- Employee E requests leave Jan 15-20

**Expected**:
- Error: shift conflict
- Cannot submit request
- Alternative dates exclude shift days
- Manager not involved (employee-side block)

### Scenario 4: Personal Overlap

**Setup**:
- Employee F has approved leave Jan 10-15
- Employee F requests leave Jan 12-20

**Expected**:
- Error: personal overlap
- Cannot submit request
- Alternative dates start after Jan 15
- Manager not involved (employee-side block)

### Scenario 5: Complex Multi-Day Conflict

**Setup**:
- 5 employees request leave during Jan 15-20
- Multiple days with conflicts
- Some days understaffed

**Expected**:
- Manager sees 6 conflict days
- Each day lists all conflicting requests
- AI gives different recommendations per day
- Manager resolves day-by-day

## Performance Considerations

### Backend

✅ **Efficient Queries**
- Uses select_related/prefetch_related
- Filters at database level
- Minimal data transfer

✅ **Caching Opportunities**
- Team size calculations
- Staffing requirements
- Leave balances

✅ **Transaction Safety**
- Resolution uses @transaction.atomic
- Rollback on any error
- Notification sent after commit

### Frontend

✅ **Optimized Rendering**
- React.memo for complex components
- Debounced date change checks
- Loading states prevent multiple calls

✅ **Data Management**
- Conflict data cached in state
- Alternative dates cached
- Dashboard data cached until refresh

⏳ **Future Optimizations**
- Add React Query for caching
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add service worker for offline support

---

## Security & Permissions

### Employee Endpoints

**Permission**: `IsAuthenticated`
- Can only check own conflicts
- Can only request own alternatives
- Cannot see other employees' data

### Manager Endpoints

**Permission**: `can_approve_leave`
- Can view all team conflicts
- Can resolve any conflict
- Can override AI recommendations
- All actions logged

### Data Privacy

✅ Employee names visible to managers (required for approval)
✅ Resolution notes stored in database
✅ Notification content includes decision reasoning
✅ Audit trail maintained via approved_by field

## Known Limitations

### Current

4. **No Conflict Preview**
   - Form doesn't show team calendar
   - Solution: Add calendar overlay

5. **Search Window Fixed**
   - Alternative dates use ±60 days
   - Solution: Make configurable

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Configurable priority rules
- [ ] Team-specific staffing minimums
- [ ] Role-based coverage requirements
- [ ] Vacation blackout periods
- [ ] Bulk conflict resolution
- [ ] Mobile app support
- [ ] Calendar visualization
