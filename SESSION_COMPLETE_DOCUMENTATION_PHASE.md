## üö® Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Security Vulnerabilities

**Risk:** Production deployment with unresolved security issues  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Mitigation:** Complete security audit and fixes as Priority 1 (next step)  
**Contingency:** Delay go-live until all CRITICAL and HIGH issues resolved

### Risk 2: Performance Under Load

**Risk:** Poor performance with real user load  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Mitigation:** Load testing with 200+ concurrent users before go-live  
**Contingency:** Scale infrastructure (more workers, better hosting, CDN)

### Risk 3: Data Loss

**Risk:** Data loss during deployment or operations  
**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Mitigation:** Automated backups, tested restore procedures, multiple backup locations  
**Contingency:** Immediate restore from most recent backup, incident response plan

### Risk 4: Deployment Failure

**Risk:** Deployment causes production outage  
**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Mitigation:** Test on staging environment, documented rollback, pre-deployment checks  
**Contingency:** Execute rollback procedure, restore from backup if needed
