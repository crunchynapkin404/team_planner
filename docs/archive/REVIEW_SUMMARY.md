## ⚠️ Issues Found (Minor - Easy to Fix)

### Test Failures (5 tests)
**Root Cause:** Test employees don't have required skills assigned

**Files Affected:**
- `team_planner/orchestrators/tests.py` - OrchestrationAPITestCase
- `team_planner/orchestrators/tests.py` - IntegrationTestCase  
- `team_planner/orchestrators/tests.py` - HolidayPolicyTestCase

**Fix:** See `TEST_FIX_GUIDE.md` for detailed solutions

### Django Deprecation Warnings (2 warnings)
**File:** `team_planner/shifts/models.py` (lines 97, 432)

**Fix:**
```python
# Change from:
models.CheckConstraint(check=Q(...), name='...')

# To:
models.CheckConstraint(condition=Q(...), name='...')
```

## 📋 Quick Action Items

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Fix test data setup** - Add skill assignments to test factory (15 min)
   - Edit: `team_planner/orchestrators/test_utils.py`
   - Add: Create incidents/waakdienst skills in `create_test_scenario()`

2. **Fix Django warnings** - Update CheckConstraint syntax (5 min)
   - Edit: `team_planner/shifts/models.py` (lines 97, 432)
   - Change: `check=` to `condition=`

### Short-term (This Week)
3. Run full test suite after fixes to confirm 100% pass rate
4. Update API documentation
5. Add performance monitoring
