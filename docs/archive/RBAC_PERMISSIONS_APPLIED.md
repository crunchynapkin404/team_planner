# RBAC Permissions Applied to Frontend

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully applied the RBAC permission system to existing frontend features. The permission-based access control is now active across navigation, shift management, swap requests, and leave management.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Navigation Service Updates

**File:** `frontend/src/services/navigationService.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `Security` icon for Role Management page
- Extended `NavigationItem` interface to support:
  - Single or multiple permissions (`permission?: string | string[]`)
  - Single or multiple roles (`role?: string | string[]`)
  - `requiresAny?: boolean` flag for OR logic on multiple permissions
- Created `hasRequiredPermissions()` helper function
- Created `canAccessItem()` helper function
- Updated all navigation items with appropriate permissions:

| Menu Item | Permission Required |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Dashboard | (None - accessible to all) |
| Calendar | `can_view_schedule` |
| Timeline | `can_view_schedule` |
| Orchestrator | `can_run_orchestrator` |
| Fairness Dashboard | `can_view_analytics` AND `can_view_schedule` |
| User Management | `can_manage_users` |
| Team Management | `can_manage_teams` |
| Role Management | `can_assign_roles` |
| Profile | (None - accessible to all) |
| Shift Swaps | (None - all users can create swaps) |
| Leave Requests | (None - all users can request leave) |
| Settings | (None - accessible to all) |

**Key Features:**
- Navigation items automatically filtered based on user permissions
- Support for combining multiple permissions (AND/OR logic)
- Backward compatible with `requiresStaff` and `requiresSuperuser` flags

### 2. Calendar Page (Shift Management)

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/CalendarPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `usePermissions` hook
- Protected shift creation with `can_create_shifts` permission
- Added permission check in `handleDateSelect()` - prevents non-authorized users from creating shifts

**Permissions Applied:**
- `can_create_shifts` - Required to create new shifts via date selection
- Viewing schedule is open to all (filtered at navigation level)

### 3. Shift Swaps Page

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/ShiftSwapsPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `usePermissions` hook
- Wrapped approve/reject buttons with permission checks
- Approve button only shows if user has `can_approve_swap`
- Reject button only shows if user has `can_reject_swap`

**Permissions Applied:**
- `can_approve_swap` - Required to approve swap requests
- `can_reject_swap` - Required to reject swap requests
- Creating swaps is available to all users (basic employee function)

**Impact:**
- Employees see incoming swap requests but cannot approve/reject
- Managers/Team Leads see approve/reject buttons on their team's swaps
- Admins/Schedulers can approve/reject all swaps

### 4. Leave Request Page

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/LeaveRequestPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `usePermissions` hook
- Updated `canApprove()` function to use RBAC permissions
- Removed legacy `user.permissions.includes()` and `is_staff` checks
- Simplified permission logic

**Permissions Applied:**
- `can_approve_leave` - Required to approve leave requests
- `can_reject_leave` - Required to reject leave requests
- Creating leave requests is available to all users

**Before:**
```typescript
const canApprove = (leaveRequest: LeaveRequest): boolean => {
  return (
    user?.permissions?.includes('leaves.change_leaverequest') ||
    user?.is_staff ||
    false
  ) && leaveRequest.status === 'pending';
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const canApprove = (leaveRequest: LeaveRequest): boolean => {
  return (
    hasPermission('can_approve_leave') && 
    leaveRequest.status === 'pending'
  );
};
```

## Permission Matrix

### By Role

| Permission | Employee | Team Lead | Scheduler | Manager | Admin |
|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| can_view_schedule | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_create_shifts | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_edit_shifts | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_delete_shifts | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_approve_swap | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_reject_swap | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_approve_leave | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_reject_leave | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_manage_teams | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can_manage_users | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| can_assign_roles | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| can_run_orchestrator | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### User Experience by Role

- ✅ Create shift swap requests
- ✅ Create leave requests
- ✅ View and manage own profile
- ❌ Cannot see admin pages in navigation
- ❌ Cannot approve/reject any requests
- ❌ Cannot create shifts

**Team Lead:**

- ✅ Approve/reject swap requests for their team
- ✅ Approve/reject leave requests for their team
- ✅ View team management page
- ❌ Cannot run orchestrator
- ❌ Cannot manage users or assign roles

**Scheduler:**
- ✅ All Employee permissions
- ✅ Create, edit shifts
- ✅ Approve/reject all swap requests
- ✅ Approve/reject all leave requests

## Technical Implementation

### Permission Hook Usage

All pages follow this pattern:

```typescript
import { usePermissions } from '../hooks/usePermissions';

const MyPage: React.FC = () => {
  const { hasPermission, hasAnyPermission, isRole } = usePermissions();
  
  // Check single permission
  if (hasPermission('can_create_shifts')) {
    // Show create button
  }
  
  // Check multiple permissions (ANY)
  if (hasAnyPermission(['can_approve_swap', 'can_reject_swap'])) {
    // Show action menu
  }
  
  // Check role
  if (isRole('admin')) {
    // Show admin-only feature
  }
};
```

### Navigation Filtering

The `SideNavigation` component automatically filters menu items:

1. Fetches current user on mount
2. Calls `navigationService.getNavigationItems(user)`
3. Service filters based on permissions, roles, and legacy flags
4. Only permitted items are rendered

### Permission Caching

- Permissions are cached for 5 minutes
- Cache is cleared on logout
- Manual refresh available via `refreshPermissions()`

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Navigation:**
- Menu items appear/disappear based on role
- Role Management only visible to admins
- Orchestrator only visible to schedulers/managers/admins

✅ **Calendar:**
- Employees can view but not create shifts
- Schedulers can create shifts via date selection
- Permission check prevents unauthorized shift creation

✅ **Shift Swaps:**
- All users can create swap requests
- Employees don't see approve/reject buttons
- Team Leads see approve/reject on their team's swaps
- Admins see approve/reject on all swaps

✅ **Leave Requests:**
- All users can create leave requests
- Employees don't see approve/reject buttons
- Managers see approve/reject on all requests
- Permission function properly refactored

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/services/navigationService.ts` - Navigation filtering with permissions
2. `frontend/src/pages/CalendarPage.tsx` - Shift creation protection
3. `frontend/src/pages/ShiftSwapsPage.tsx` - Approve/reject button visibility
4. `frontend/src/pages/LeaveRequestPage.tsx` - Permission-based approval logic

## Still To Do

### High Priority
- [ ] Apply permissions to Team Management page
- [ ] Apply permissions to User Management page
- [ ] Apply permissions to Orchestrator page
- [ ] Add role badges to user lists throughout app

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Backend permission enforcement on existing views
  - [ ] Shift views
  - [ ] Swap views
  - [ ] Leave views
  - [ ] Orchestrator views
- [ ] Integration tests for permission filtering
- [ ] Test role changes and permission updates

### Low Priority
- [ ] User guide for permissions
- [ ] Developer guide for adding permission checks
- [ ] Update existing documentation

## Docker Status

✅ **Containers Running:**
- Django: `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3001`

✅ **Hot Reload Active:**
- All TypeScript changes automatically compiled
- React components hot-reloaded
- No manual restarts needed

## Next Steps

1. **Apply to Remaining Pages:**
   - TeamManagement.tsx
   - UserManagement.tsx
   - UnifiedOrchestratorPage.tsx

2. **Backend Enforcement:**
   - Add permission checks to Django views
   - Return 403 for unauthorized access
   - Add permission decorators

3. **Testing:**
   - Create integration tests
   - Test permission edge cases
   - Verify role transitions

4. **Polish:**
   - Add permission denied messages
   - Improve UI feedback
   - Add role badges throughout

## Summary

The RBAC permission system is now integrated into the main user-facing features. Navigation automatically adapts to user permissions, and critical actions (approve, reject, create) are protected. The system is ready for backend enforcement and comprehensive testing.
