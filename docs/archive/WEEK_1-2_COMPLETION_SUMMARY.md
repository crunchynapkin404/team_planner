- ✅ Backup codes download and copy
- ✅ Response format handling for development/production

#### Key Files Modified/Created
```
Backend:
- team_planner/users/models.py (TwoFactorDevice, MFALoginAttempt)
- team_planner/users/api/mfa_views.py (288 lines)
- team_planner/users/api/auth_views.py (68 lines)
- team_planner/users/permissions.py (NEW - AllowAny for pre-auth)
- config/api_router.py (MFA routes)
- requirements/base.txt (pyotp, qrcode)

Frontend:
- frontend/src/components/auth/MFASetup.tsx (318 lines)
- frontend/src/components/auth/MFALogin.tsx (199 lines)
- frontend/src/components/auth/MFASettings.tsx (372 lines)
- frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx (MFA integration)
- frontend/src/pages/ProfileManagement.tsx (MFA settings)
```

#### Bugs Fixed During Implementation
1. ✅ Response handling - Fixed to support both `response.data` and direct response
2. ✅ Login flow - Created custom endpoint to check MFA before issuing token
3. ✅ Permission decorator - Added `@permission_classes([AllowAny])` to verification endpoint
4. ✅ User ID passing - Added user_id to MFA verification request
5. ✅ UI state - Fixed conditional to check both `enabled` AND `verified` status

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 3-4: RBAC)

### Currently In Progress

#### 1. Role-Based Access Control Models ✅
- ✅ `UserRole` enum (EMPLOYEE, TEAM_LEAD, SCHEDULER, MANAGER, ADMIN)
- ✅ `RolePermission` model with 20+ granular permissions
- ✅ Permission utilities (`check_user_permission`, `get_user_permissions`)
- ✅ DRF permission classes (`IsManager`, `IsScheduler`, `CanManageTeam`)
- ✅ Migration created for RolePermission model
- ✅ Data migration for default role permissions

#### 2. Remaining RBAC Tasks
- [ ] Run migrations to apply RolePermission changes
- [ ] Create RBAC API endpoints (rbac_views.py)
- [ ] Create serializers for roles and permissions
- [ ] Build frontend role management UI
- [ ] Add role assignment interface
- [ ] Test permission enforcement across endpoints
- [ ] Update existing views to use role permissions

## 🐛 Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: 401 Error During MFA Verification
**Problem:** MFA verification endpoint required authentication, but users don't have token yet  
**Solution:** Added `@permission_classes([AllowAny])` decorator  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: MFA Status Not Updating in UI
**Problem:** Conditional checked only `enabled`, not `verified`  
**Solution:** Changed to `!mfaStatus?.enabled || !mfaStatus?.verified`  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 3: Session Not Persisting for MFA
**Problem:** `withCredentials: false` prevented session cookies  
**Solution:** Pass `user_id` in request body as fallback  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

## 📝 Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] User guide for MFA setup
- [ ] Admin guide for role management
- [ ] API documentation for MFA endpoints
- [ ] Deployment guide updates
- [ ] Email configuration guide (for registration)

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### MFA Adoption
- Target: 80% of active users enable MFA within 30 days
- Measurement: Track `TwoFactorDevice.is_verified` count

### Security
- Zero unauthorized access incidents
- All MFA login attempts logged
- Failed attempt rate < 5%

### User Experience
- MFA setup completion time < 2 minutes
- Support tickets related to MFA < 10/month
- User satisfaction score > 4/5

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ TOTP with 30-second window (prevents replay attacks)
- ✅ Backup codes (one-time use, securely hashed)
- ✅ Login attempt logging with IP and user agent
- ✅ Token-based authentication
- ✅ Email verification for new registrations

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Rate limiting on MFA verification
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] SMS backup option
- [ ] WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
- [ ] MFA recovery process for locked accounts
