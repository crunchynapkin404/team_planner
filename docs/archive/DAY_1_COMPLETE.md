## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Decisions

1. **TOTP over SMS**
   - Rationale: Better security, no ongoing costs
   - Impact: Users need authenticator app
   - Alternative: Can add SMS later as optional

2. **10 Backup Codes**
   - Rationale: Industry standard, balances security vs usability
   - Impact: Users must store codes securely
   - Alternative: Could reduce to 5 or increase to 20

3. **30-Second Time Window**
   - Rationale: Handles minor clock drift
   - Impact: Slightly reduced security for better UX
   - Alternative: Could use 0-second window for max security

4. **Password Required to Disable**
   - Rationale: Prevents unauthorized MFA removal
   - Impact: Users must remember password
   - Alternative: Could use token-only or email confirmation

### Architecture Decisions

1. **OneToOne Device Relationship**
   - Rationale: Simple for MVP, extensible later
   - Impact: One device per user initially
   - Future: Can extend to multiple devices

2. **JSON Field for Backup Codes**
   - Rationale: Simple, efficient for small arrays
   - Impact: No need for separate table
   - Future: Could normalize if needed

3. **Separate Login Attempt Model**
   - Rationale: Security monitoring critical
   - Impact: Additional database writes
   - Future: Can archive old attempts
