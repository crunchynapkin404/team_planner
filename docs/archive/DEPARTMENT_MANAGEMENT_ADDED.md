# Department Management - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Added full CRUD operations for department management to the Unified Management Console.

## Problem
Users could not create teams because no departments existed in the database, and teams require a department to be created.

## Solution
Added a collapsible department management section to the Teams tab with the following features:

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Department Section (Top of Teams Tab)
- **Location**: Paper container at the top of Teams tab
- **Toggle**: Show/Hide button to collapse/expand department list
- **Create Button**: "Create Department" button for quick access

#### 2. Department List Display
- **Table Format**: Name, Description, Actions columns
- **Empty State**: Message prompting users to create first department
- **Loading State**: Spinner while fetching data

#### 3. Department Dialog
- **Fields**:
  - Department Name (required)
  - Description (multiline, optional)
  - Manager (dropdown of users, optional)
- **Modes**: Create new or Edit existing department

#### 4. Department Actions
- **Create**: POST to `/api/departments/`
- **Edit**: PATCH to `/api/departments/{id}/`
- **Delete**: DELETE to `/api/departments/{id}/`
  - Warning: Deleting department deletes all teams in it

#### 5. Team Creation Protection
- **Disabled State**: "Create Team" button disabled if no departments exist
- **Info Alert**: Shows message to create department first

## Technical Details

### Backend API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/departments/` (already existed)
- **ViewSet**: `DepartmentViewSet` in `teams/api_views.py`
- **Serializer**: `DepartmentSerializer` in `teams/serializers.py`
- **Model Fields**:
  - `id` (auto)
  - `name` (CharField, unique)
  - `description` (TextField, optional)
  - `manager` (ForeignKey to User, optional)
  - `created`, `modified` (timestamps)

### Frontend Component
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/UnifiedManagement.tsx`
- **New State**:
  - `departmentDialogOpen`: Dialog visibility
  - `selectedDepartment`: Current department being edited
  - `departmentFormData`: Form state (name, description, manager)
  - `showDepartments`: Toggle visibility of department list
  
- **New Functions**:
  - `handleCreateDepartment()`: Opens dialog for new department
  - `handleEditDepartment()`: Opens dialog with existing data
  - `handleSaveDepartment()`: POST/PATCH API call
  - `handleDeleteDepartment()`: DELETE API call with confirmation

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Workflow Guidance**: Clear message that departments must be created first
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Department section can be collapsed to reduce clutter
3. **Inline Management**: All department operations in same tab as teams
4. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Warns about cascade deletion of teams
