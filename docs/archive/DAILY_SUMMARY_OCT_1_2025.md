## Testing Results - All Passing ✅

### Registration Flow
```bash
# 1. Register user
POST /api/auth/register/
Result: User created (inactive) ✅

# 2. Admin approves via UI or API
PATCH /api/users/5/ {"is_active": true}
Result: User activated ✅

# 3. User can login
POST /api/auth/login/
Result: Token issued ✅
```

### RBAC System
```bash
# Get permissions
GET /api/users/me/permissions/
Result: Full permission object returned ✅

# List users with roles
GET /api/rbac/users/
Result: All users with role info ✅

# Change user role
PATCH /api/rbac/users/5/role/ {"role": "manager"}

### For Developers

**Check Permissions:**
```typescript
import { usePermissions } from '../hooks/usePermissions';

const { hasPermission, isRole } = usePermissions();

if (hasPermission('can_create_shifts')) {
  // Show create button
}
```

**Use Permission Gate:**
```typescript
import PermissionGate from '../components/auth/PermissionGate';

<PermissionGate permission="can_edit_shifts">
  <EditButton />
</PermissionGate>
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Apply Permissions to Pages** - Add PermissionGates to existing features
2. **Update Navigation** - Hide menu items based on permissions
3. **Add Role Badges** - Display roles in user lists

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. **Backend Permission Enforcement** - Add checks to all views
2. **Integration Testing** - Test complete flows
3. **UI Polish** - Improve error messages and loading states

### Medium Term
1. **Email Integration** - When email server available
2. **Advanced MFA** - SMS, WebAuthn support
3. **Permission Auditing** - Log permission checks

---

## Lessons Learned Today

1. **Admin Approval > Email Verification** - Much simpler for servers without email
2. **ID Lookups Are Important** - Frontend naturally uses IDs, not usernames
3. **Caching Improves Performance** - 5-minute cache reduces API calls significantly
4. **Declarative Permission Checks** - PermissionGate makes code cleaner
5. **Import Paths Matter** - Relative imports need correct directory depth
