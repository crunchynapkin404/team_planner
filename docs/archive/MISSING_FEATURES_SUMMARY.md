## 📝 Decision Matrix

### Should We Build or Buy?

#### Build Internal
**Pros:**
- ✅ Full customization
- ✅ Owns the IP
- ✅ No licensing fees
- ✅ Integration control

**Cons:**
- ❌ 20-24 weeks to full feature set
- ❌ $150-200K investment
- ❌ Ongoing maintenance
- ❌ Team expertise needed

#### Buy/Integrate Existing
**Pros:**
- ✅ Immediate availability
- ✅ Proven reliability
- ✅ Professional support
- ✅ Regular updates

**Cons:**
- ❌ Monthly/annual fees
- ❌ Limited customization
- ❌ Vendor lock-in
- ❌ Integration complexity

### Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach**
1. Keep core scheduling engine (already built)
2. Add critical missing features (8-10 weeks)
3. Integrate third-party for:
   - SMS/WhatsApp (Twilio)
   - Push notifications (Firebase)
   - Calendar sync (Nylas/Cronofy)
   - Analytics (Metabase/Grafana)

**Best of both worlds:**
- Custom core + proven add-ons
- Faster time to market
- Lower total cost
- Reduced maintenance
