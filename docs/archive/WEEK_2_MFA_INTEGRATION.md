# Week 2: MFA Frontend Integration & Testing
## Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ In Progress  
**Focus:** Complete MFA implementation with frontend integration and comprehensive testing

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. ‚úÖ Integrate MFA settings into user profile page
2. ‚è≥ Test complete MFA workflow end-to-end
3. ‚è≥ Implement security enhancements (rate limiting, lockout)
4. ‚è≥ Create user documentation

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend Implementation (Week 1)
- ‚úÖ **Models Created:**
  - `TwoFactorDevice` - Stores TOTP secrets and backup codes
  - `MFALoginAttempt` - Tracks login attempts for security monitoring
  
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/users/mfa/setup/` - Initialize MFA setup
  - `POST /api/users/mfa/verify/` - Verify TOTP token
  - `POST /api/users/mfa/disable/` - Disable MFA
  - `POST /api/users/mfa/login-verify/` - Verify MFA during login
  - `GET /api/users/mfa/status/` - Get MFA status
  - `POST /api/users/mfa/regenerate-backup-codes/` - Regenerate backup codes

- ‚úÖ **Tests:** 18 unit tests passing
  - Device creation and management
  - TOTP token verification
  - Backup code generation and verification
  - Complete workflow tests

### 2. Frontend Components (Week 1)
- ‚úÖ **Components Created:**
  - `MFASetup.tsx` - QR code display and setup wizard
  - `MFALogin.tsx` - MFA token verification during login
  - `MFASettings.tsx` - MFA management in user profile

### 3. Frontend Integration (Week 2 - Today)
- ‚úÖ **Profile Page Integration:**
  - Added MFASettings component to ProfileManagement.tsx
  - Integrated into existing security settings section
  - Positioned between password settings and notifications

---

## ‚è≥ In Progress

### 1. End-to-End Testing
Need to verify the complete workflow:

#### **MFA Setup Flow:**
1. User logs in with username/password
2. Navigates to Profile ‚Üí Security Settings
3. Clicks "Enable MFA"
4. Scans QR code with authenticator app (or enters manual key)
5. Enters verification code
6. Saves backup codes
7. MFA is enabled

#### **MFA Login Flow:**
1. User enters username/password
2. System detects MFA is enabled
3. Prompts for TOTP token
4. User enters 6-digit code from authenticator app
5. Successfully logs in

#### **Backup Code Flow:**
1. User can't access authenticator app
2. Uses backup code instead of TOTP
3. Backup code is consumed (one-time use)
4. Successfully logs in

#### **Disable MFA Flow:**
1. User navigates to Security Settings
2. Clicks "Disable MFA"
3. Enters current password and TOTP token
4. MFA is disabled

## üîí Security Enhancements Needed

### 1. Rate Limiting
**File to create:** `team_planner/users/middleware/mfa_rate_limit.py`

```python
from django.core.cache import cache
from rest_framework.throttling import AnonRateThrottle, UserRateThrottle

class MFAVerificationThrottle(UserRateThrottle):
    """Rate limit MFA verification attempts."""
    rate = '5/hour'  # 5 attempts per hour per user
    
class MFASetupThrottle(UserRateThrottle):
    """Rate limit MFA setup attempts."""
    rate = '3/hour'  # 3 setup attempts per hour
```

### 2. Account Lockout
**Feature:** Lock account after 5 failed MFA attempts for 15 minutes

**Implementation needed in:** `team_planner/users/api/mfa_views.py`

```python
def check_lockout(user):
    """Check if user is locked out due to failed attempts."""
    cache_key = f'mfa_lockout_{user.id}'
    attempts_key = f'mfa_attempts_{user.id}'
    
    # Check if locked out
    if cache.get(cache_key):
        return True, "Account locked due to too many failed attempts"
    
    # Track attempts
    attempts = cache.get(attempts_key, 0)
    if attempts >= 5:
        cache.set(cache_key, True, 900)  # 15 minute lockout
        return True, "Account locked due to too many failed attempts"
    
    return False, None
```

### 3. Audit Logging
- All MFA events are logged to `MFALoginAttempt` model
- Track IP addresses and user agents
- Monitor for suspicious patterns

---

## üìö Documentation Needed

### 1. User Guide
**File to create:** `docs/user_guides/mfa_setup_guide.md`

Topics to cover:
- What is MFA and why use it?
- How to set up MFA
- Recommended authenticator apps
- How to use backup codes
- Troubleshooting

### 2. API Documentation
**Add to:** `docs/api/authentication.md`

Document all MFA endpoints with:
- Request/response examples
- Error codes
- Security considerations

### 3. Admin Guide
**File to create:** `docs/admin_guides/mfa_management.md`

Topics:
- Forcing MFA for staff users
- Resetting MFA for locked users
- Monitoring MFA adoption
- Security best practices

## üîç How to Test MFA Right Now

### 1. Access the Application
```
Frontend: http://localhost:3001
Backend: http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Login
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### 3. Navigate to Profile
- Click on user profile icon
- Go to "Profile Management"
- Scroll to "Multi-Factor Authentication" section

### 4. Enable MFA
- Click "Enable MFA"
- Scan QR code with Google Authenticator app
- Enter verification code
- Save backup codes

### 5. Test Login
- Logout
- Login again
- Should prompt for MFA token
- Enter 6-digit code from app

---

## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **TOTP over SMS:** More secure, no carrier dependency
2. **Backup codes:** 10 codes, one-time use, regenerate-able
3. **QR codes:** Base64 embedded for security
4. **Session-based:** MFA verification in session before token issuance

### Known Limitations
- No SMS fallback
- No email-based recovery (by design)
- Requires authenticator app

### Future Enhancements
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
- Biometric authentication
- Remember device for 30 days
- Admin panel for MFA management

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**QR Code Not Displaying:**
- Check backend logs for QR generation errors
- Verify pyotp and qrcode packages installed

**Invalid Token Error:**
- Check device time synchronization
- TOTP requires accurate clocks (30s window)
- Allow 1-minute window for clock drift

**Can't Disable MFA:**
- Requires both password and valid TOTP token
- Use backup code if authenticator unavailable

**Backend Not Accessible:**
- Check Docker containers running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs django`
