# Team Planner - Strategic Next Steps Roadmap

Based on the current project state analysis, here are the prioritized next steps to transform your team planner into a fully functional system:

## üö® **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Week 1-2)**

### 1. **Fix Core Employee Availability Logic** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem**: Tests show no employees are being identified as available for shifts
**Impact**: System cannot schedule anyone - core functionality broken

**Action Steps**:
```bash
# Debug employee skills assignment
python3 manage.py shell
> from team_planner.employees.models import EmployeeProfile
> profiles = EmployeeProfile.objects.all()
> for p in profiles: print(f"{p.user.username}: {list(p.skills.all())}")
```

**Fix Required**:
- Ensure employees have proper skills assigned (incidents, waakdienst)
- Verify skill-based filtering in `ConstraintChecker`
- Check business hours configuration in availability detection

### 2. **Fix Test Authentication Setup** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem**: 8 API tests failing due to authentication issues
**Impact**: Cannot verify API functionality works

**Action Steps**:
- Fix test user permissions in `OrchestrationAPITestCase`
- Ensure test users have staff permissions for orchestration APIs
- Update test fixtures with proper authentication tokens

### 3. **Create Seed Data for Development** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem**: No sample data to test with
**Impact**: Hard to develop and demonstrate features

**Action Steps**:
```bash
# Use existing seeding utility
python3 manage.py shell
> from team_planner.utils.seeding import seed_demo_data
> seed_demo_data(count=10, create_admin=True)
```

## üéØ **HIGH PRIORITY (Week 3-4)**

### 4. **Complete Employee Skill Management** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Missing Features**:
- Automatic skill assignment based on availability flags
- Skill validation in employee profiles
- UI for managing employee skills

**Implementation**:
- Fix the `_assign_skills_based_on_availability` method
- Add skill management to admin interface
- Create employee skill assignment API endpoints

### 5. **Fix Orchestrator Business Logic** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Issues Identified**:
- Holiday handling not working correctly
- Fairness calculation has errors
- Schedule generation produces zero shifts

**Action Steps**:
- Debug `FairnessCalculator.calculate_current_assignments`
- Fix holiday policy in orchestrator algorithms
- Verify time window calculations

### 6. **Frontend Integration** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current State**: Frontend exists but needs integration testing
**Required**:
- Fix ESLint configuration
- Verify API client connections
- Test orchestrator UI components

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run test
npm run dev  # Test frontend connectivity
```

## üîß **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Week 5-8)**

### 7. **Improve Error Handling and Logging** ‚≠ê
**Current Issues**:
- Many broad `Exception` catches
- Inconsistent logging patterns
- Poor error messages in APIs

**Improvements**:
- Replace broad exception handling with specific exceptions
- Standardize logging format
- Add proper error responses in APIs

### 8. **Performance Optimization** ‚≠ê
**Areas to Optimize**:
- Database queries in orchestrators (add select_related/prefetch_related)
- Large date range handling
- Concurrent request handling

### 9. **Enhanced Leave Management** ‚≠ê
**Missing Features**:
- Recurring leave pattern improvements
- Leave conflict resolution UI
- Automatic shift reassignment on leave approval

## üöÄ **ADVANCED FEATURES (Week 9-12)**

### 10. **Real-time Updates** 
- WebSocket integration for live schedule updates
- Real-time notifications for shift changes
- Live availability status

### 11. **Reporting and Analytics**
- Fairness distribution reports
- Employee workload analytics
- Schedule efficiency metrics

### 12. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Optimize UI for mobile devices
- Consider mobile app or PWA
- Touch-friendly schedule interface

## üé™ **PRODUCTION READINESS (Week 13-16)**

### 13. **Security Hardening**
- Replace hardcoded passwords with environment variables
- Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Add rate limiting to APIs
- Security audit of user permissions

### 14. **Deployment and Operations**
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Production Docker configuration
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 15. **Documentation and Training**
- User manual creation
- Admin guide development
- API documentation with examples
- Video tutorials for key features

## üìä **SUCCESS METRICS**

**Technical Metrics**:
- ‚úÖ 95%+ test pass rate (currently 74%)
- ‚úÖ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ < 2 second API response times
- ‚úÖ 99.9% uptime in production

**Business Metrics**:
- ‚úÖ Successful schedule generation for test scenarios
- ‚úÖ Employee satisfaction with fairness distribution
- ‚úÖ Reduction in manual schedule adjustments
- ‚úÖ Time saved compared to manual scheduling

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recommended Immediate Actions (This Week)**

1. **Start Here - Employee Skills Debug**:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
   python3 manage.py shell
   # Check employee skills and availability
   ```

2. **Fix One Test Category**:
   ```bash
   # Focus on ConstraintCheckerTestCase first
   python3 manage.py test team_planner.orchestrators.tests.ConstraintCheckerTestCase -v 2
   ```

3. **Set Up Development Data**:
   ```bash
   # Create sample employees and teams
   python3 manage.py shell
   > from team_planner.utils.seeding import seed_demo_data
   > summary = seed_demo_data(count=5, create_admin=True)
   > print(summary)
   ```

4. **Verify Core Workflow**:
   - Create test team with employees
   - Assign skills to employees
   - Try generating a simple schedule
   - Document what works and what doesn't

## üí° **Pro Tips for Success**

1. **Focus on One Feature at a Time**: Don't try to fix everything simultaneously
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Fix tests as you implement features
3. **Incremental Progress**: Make small, verifiable improvements
4. **Document Discoveries**: Keep notes on what you learn about the business logic
5. **User Feedback Early**: Get feedback on core scheduling logic before advanced features

This roadmap will transform your team planner from a cleaned-up codebase into a fully functional scheduling system. Start with the immediate priorities to get core functionality working, then build out the advanced features systematically.
