## Technical Implementation

### Files Created

#### 1. **MobileCalendar.tsx** (512 lines)
`/home/vscode/team_planner/frontend/src/components/calendar/MobileCalendar.tsx`

**Purpose:** Touch-optimized calendar component for mobile devices

**Key Features:**
- Month grid layout with touch-friendly day cells
- Swipe gestures for month navigation (left/right)
- Event indicators (colored dots) on days with events
- Touch-optimized UI with larger touch targets
- Swipeable bottom drawer for event details
- Floating action buttons (Today, Filter)
- Date selection and event viewing
- Responsive typography and spacing

**Components Used:**
- Material-UI components (Paper, Card, Drawer, Fab, Badge, Avatar)
- date-fns for date manipulation
- SwipeableDrawer for bottom sheet
- useMediaQuery for responsive breakpoints

**API:**
```typescript
interface MobileCalendarProps {
  events: CalendarEvent[];
  onEventClick?: (event: CalendarEvent) => void;
  onDateSelect?: (date: Date) => void;
  onSwipeLeft?: () => void;
  onSwipeRight?: () => void;
}
```

**Touch Interactions:**
- Tap day cell: Select date and show events
- Swipe left: Next month
- Swipe right: Previous month
- Drag drawer: Open/close event details
- Tap FAB: Today or filters

#### 2. **ResponsiveCalendar.tsx** (110 lines)
`/home/vscode/team_planner/frontend/src/components/calendar/ResponsiveCalendar.tsx`

**Purpose:** Wrapper component that automatically switches between desktop and mobile views

**Key Features:**
- Automatic view detection using useMediaQuery
- Seamless event adapter between mobile and desktop APIs
- Breakpoint: `theme.breakpoints.down('md')` (768px)
- Type-safe event conversions
- No duplicate code
- Single entry point for calendar

**View Logic:**
- **Desktop (md+):** Uses FullCalendar with multiple views
- **Mobile (sm-):** Uses MobileCalendar with touch interface

**API:**
```typescript
interface ResponsiveCalendarProps {
  events: CalendarEvent[];
  onEventDrop?: (info: EventDropArg) => void;
  onEventClick?: (info: EventClickArg) => void;
  onDateSelect?: (info: DateSelectArg) => void;
}
```

### Files Modified

#### 3. **calendar.ts** (Types)
`/home/vscode/team_planner/frontend/src/types/calendar.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- Made `shiftType` and `leaveType` accept `string` instead of strict unions
- Made `status` and `eventType` optional for better flexibility
- Shared type across all calendar components
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Before:**
```typescript
shiftType?: 'incident' | 'incidents' | 'incidents_standby' | ...;
status: 'confirmed' | 'pending' | ...;
```

**After:**
```typescript
shiftType?: string;
status?: string;
```

**Reasoning:** Allows for future shift types without breaking existing code

#### 4. **Calendar.tsx** (Desktop)
`/home/vscode/team_planner/frontend/src/components/calendar/Calendar.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Removed local `CalendarEvent` interface
- Import shared type from `../../types/calendar`
- No behavioral changes
- Maintains all existing functionality

#### 5. **CalendarPage.tsx**
`/home/vscode/team_planner/frontend/src/pages/CalendarPage.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Import `ResponsiveCalendar` instead of `Calendar`
- Component automatically adapts to screen size
- Removed unused `formatDate` import
- Fixed date formatting in confirm dialog

**Before:**
```typescript
import Calendar from '../components/calendar/Calendar';

<Calendar events={events} ... />
```

**After:**
```typescript
import ResponsiveCalendar from '../components/calendar/ResponsiveCalendar';

<ResponsiveCalendar events={events} ... />
```
