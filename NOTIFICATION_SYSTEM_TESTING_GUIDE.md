## üîç API Testing (Optional)

### Test with cURL

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/unread_count/
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"unread_count": 5}
```

**2. List Notifications:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 10,
  "next": "...",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "notification_type": "leave_approved",
      "title": "Leave Approved",
      "message": "Your leave request has been approved...",
      "is_read": false,
      "action_url": "/leaves/1",
      "created": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**3. Mark as Read:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/1/mark_read/
```

**4. Get Preferences:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/notification-preferences/my_preferences/
```

**5. Update Preferences:**
```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email_leave_approved": false}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/notification-preferences/my_preferences/
```
