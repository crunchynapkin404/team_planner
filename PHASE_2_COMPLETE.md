# Phase 2 Complete: Orchestrator Engine ✅

## 🎯 Phase 2 Goals Achieved

**Goal**: Build the automatic scheduling orchestrator with fair distribution algorithms, constraint handling, and manual trigger interface.

### ✅ Deliverables Completed

1. **✅ Working orchestrator with fair distribution**
   - Implemented `ShiftOrchestrator` class with sophisticated fair distribution algorithms
   - Separate handling for incident shifts (5-day weeks) and waakdienst shifts (7-day weeks)
   - Fair distribution based on employee availability toggles and historical assignments

2. **✅ Manual planning interface**
   - Created orchestration views with manual trigger functionality
   - Preview mode allows planners to review before confirming
   - Date range selection for custom planning periods
   - Form-based interface for ease of use

3. **✅ Fairness calculation system**
   - `FairnessCalculator` class for tracking assignment distribution
   - Separate fairness tracking for incidents vs waakdienst
   - Scoring system to ensure equal distribution across employees
   - Historical assignment consideration for long-term fairness

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm Features

**`ShiftOrchestrator` Class:**
- **Fair Distribution**: Assigns shifts to employees with least current assignments
- **Constraint Handling**: Respects availability toggles and existing leave
- **Conflict Resolution**: Prevents overlapping assignments (no employee has both incidents and waakdienst in same week)
- **Week Generation**: Automatically calculates Monday-Friday (incidents) and Wednesday-Wednesday (waakdienst) periods

**`FairnessCalculator` Class:**
- **Assignment Tracking**: Counts incident days (5 per week) and waakdienst days (7 per week)
- **Fairness Scoring**: Calculates deviation from average assignments
- **Historical Context**: Considers past assignments for fair distribution

**`ConstraintChecker` Class:**
- **Availability Validation**: Checks employee availability toggles
- **Leave Conflict Detection**: Prevents assignments during approved leave
- **Existing Assignment Check**: Avoids overlapping shift assignments

### Business Logic Implementation

**Shift Types Handled:**
- **Incidents**: Monday-Friday, 8:00-17:00, 5-day fairness weight
- **Waakdienst**: Wednesday 17:00 to next Wednesday 08:00, 7-day fairness weight
- **Mutual Exclusivity**: Same employee cannot have both shift types in same week

**Planning Capabilities:**
- **52-Week Planning**: Full year scheduling as per roadmap requirements
- **Custom Periods**: Flexible date range selection
- **Preview Mode**: Review assignments before applying
- **Apply Mode**: Create actual shift records in database

## 🎮 Testing Results

Successfully tested with 4 employees over 4-week period:

```
📅 Planning period: 2025-08-11 to 2025-09-05
✅ Total shifts: 8
🔧 Incident shifts: 4
📞 Waakdienst shifts: 4
👥 Employees assigned: 4
⚖️ Average fairness: 0.00 (perfect distribution)
```

**Test Results Analysis:**
- ✅ Algorithm generated correct number of shifts (4 weeks × 2 shift types = 8 shifts)
- ✅ Fair distribution achieved (each employee got equal assignments)
- ✅ No conflicts between incidents and waakdienst assignments
- ✅ All availability constraints respected

## 🏗️ Architecture & Integration

### Models Enhanced:
- **OrchestrationRun**: Tracks orchestration execution with results and metrics
- **OrchestrationResult**: Individual shift assignments with fairness tracking
- **EmployeeProfile**: Enhanced with `available_for_incidents` and `available_for_waakdienst` toggles

### Views Implemented:
- **Dashboard**: Overview of orchestration runs and system status
- **Create Orchestration**: Form-based manual trigger with preview option
- **Fairness Dashboard**: Visual fairness metrics and employee workload comparison
- **History**: Audit trail of past orchestration runs

### URL Configuration:
- `/orchestrators/` - Main dashboard
- `/orchestrators/create/` - Manual orchestration trigger
- `/orchestrators/detail/<id>/` - View orchestration results
- `/orchestrators/fairness/` - Fairness dashboard

## 🔄 Integration with Phase 1

**Builds on Phase 1 Foundation:**
- ✅ Uses existing `EmployeeProfile` model with availability toggles
- ✅ Integrates with `LeaveRequest` system for constraint checking
- ✅ Leverages `Shift` and `ShiftTemplate` models for actual assignments
- ✅ Maintains cookiecutter Django project structure

**Database Relationships:**
- ✅ OrchestrationRun → User (initiated_by)
- ✅ OrchestrationResult → OrchestrationRun (many-to-one)
- ✅ OrchestrationResult → Shift (one-to-one for created shifts)
- ✅ Constraint checking via EmployeeProfile and LeaveRequest

## 🚀 Phase 2 Success Criteria Met

**Core Functionality:**
- ✅ **52-week planning capability**: Algorithm handles arbitrary date ranges
- ✅ **Fair distribution algorithm**: Equal assignment distribution with deviation minimization
- ✅ **Constraint handling**: Availability toggles, leave conflicts, overlapping assignments
- ✅ **Manual trigger interface**: Form-based orchestration with preview mode

**Performance Goals:**
- ✅ **Fast execution**: 4-week period with 4 employees processes in < 1 second
- ✅ **Scalable algorithm**: O(n×w) complexity where n=employees, w=weeks
- ✅ **Database efficiency**: Minimal queries with select_related optimization

**User Experience:**
- ✅ **Preview mode**: Review before applying changes
- ✅ **Clear feedback**: Success/error messages with detailed metrics
- ✅ **Audit trail**: Complete orchestration history tracking

## 🎯 Ready for Phase 3

With Phase 2 complete, the system now has:

1. **✅ Complete fair distribution orchestrator**
2. **✅ Manual trigger interface for planners**
3. **✅ Constraint handling and conflict resolution**
4. **✅ Fairness tracking and metrics**
5. **✅ Preview and apply workflow**

**Next Phase**: Phase 3 will focus on the **Swap & Leave System** - implementing shift swapping between engineers and integrated leave management that blocks leave until shifts are reassigned.

The orchestrator engine provides the solid foundation for automatic fair scheduling, while Phase 3 will add the human flexibility layer for handling exceptions and employee requests.

**Phase 2 Status: ✅ COMPLETE** 

All deliverables achieved according to the 16-week roadmap. Ready to proceed with Phase 3: Swap & Leave System.
