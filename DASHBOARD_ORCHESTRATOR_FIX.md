# Dashboard Orchestrator Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Summary
When running the orchestrator from the React dashboard, it was creating 0 shifts in the database despite showing 322 incidents in the results, even when the "Preview Only" option was not selected.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue had **two separate problems**:

1. **UI/API Default Problem**: Both frontend and backend defaulted to "preview mode"
2. **Critical Bug**: The incidents orchestrator was creating assignment objects without the required `template` field, causing all assignments to fail shift creation validation

## Root Cause Details

### Problem 1: Preview Mode Defaults
- **Frontend Issue**: `UnifiedOrchestratorPage.tsx` defaulted `previewOnly = true`
- **Backend API Issue**: Both legacy API (`api.py`) and V2 API (`api_v2.py`) defaulted `preview_only = True` when not provided
- **Result**: Even when users didn't select "Preview Only", the orchestrator ran in preview mode

### Problem 2: Missing Template Field (The Critical Bug)
- **Core Issue**: In `team_planner/orchestrators/incidents.py`, assignment dictionaries were created manually without the `template` field
- **Validation Failure**: `UnifiedOrchestrator.apply_schedule()` validates assignments with `if not all([template, employee_id, start_dt, end_dt]):` 
- **Result**: All assignments failed validation and no shifts were created, even though the orchestrator ran successfully

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend API Fixes (Preview Mode Defaults)
**File: `team_planner/orchestrators/api.py` (Legacy API)**
```python
# BEFORE:
_raw_preview = data.get("preview_only", True)  # Defaulted to True

# AFTER:
_raw_preview = data.get("preview_only", False)  # Now defaults to False
```

**File: `team_planner/orchestrators/api_v2.py` (V2 API)**
```python
# BEFORE:
preview_only = data.get("preview_only", True)  # Defaulted to True

# AFTER:
preview_only = data.get("preview_only", False)  # Now defaults to False
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (Preview Mode Default)
**File: `frontend/src/pages/UnifiedOrchestratorPage.tsx`**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const [previewOnly, setPreviewOnly] = useState(true);  // Defaulted to true

// AFTER:
const [previewOnly, setPreviewOnly] = useState(false); // Now defaults to false
```

### 3. Critical Bug Fix (Missing Template Field)
**File: `team_planner/orchestrators/incidents.py`**
```python
# BEFORE: Manual assignment creation without template
assignment = {
    "assigned_employee_id": chosen_employee.pk,
    "start_datetime": day_start,
    "end_datetime": day_end,
    "shift_type": "incidents",
    "duration_hours": duration_hours,
    "assignment_reason": f"Week-long assignment ({period_label}) - {day_label}",
    "template_name": "Incidents Daily Shift",  # Only template name, no template object
}

# AFTER: Include actual template object
assignment = {
    "assigned_employee_id": chosen_employee.pk,
    "assigned_employee_name": chosen_employee.get_full_name() or chosen_employee.username,
    "start_datetime": day_start,
    "end_datetime": day_end,
    "shift_type": "incidents",
    "duration_hours": duration_hours,
    "assignment_reason": f"Week-long assignment ({period_label}) - {day_label}",
    "template": template,  # ✅ Added actual template object
    "template_id": template.pk if template else None,
    "template_name": "Incidents Daily Shift",
    "auto_assigned": True,
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Before Fix:
- Frontend: `preview_only: true` (by default)
- API: Processes as `true` (if missing, defaults to `true`)
- Result: **Always runs in preview mode** → No shifts created

### After Fix:
- Frontend: `preview_only: false` (by default)
- API: Processes as `false` (if missing, defaults to `false`)
- Result: **Runs in apply mode** → Shifts are created and saved to database

## User Experience Changes

### Before:
- User had to **uncheck** "Preview Only" to create actual shifts
- Confusing because the default behavior didn't match user expectations
- Dashboard showed incidents count but 0 total shifts

### After:
- Dashboard **creates actual shifts by default** ✅
- User can **check** "Preview Only" if they want to preview without saving
- Intuitive behavior that matches user expectations

## Validation

The fix has been tested and confirmed to:
- ✅ Default to creating actual database shifts when "Preview Only" is unchecked (default)
- ✅ Still support preview mode when "Preview Only" is explicitly checked
- ✅ Handle all parameter combinations correctly (boolean, string, missing)
- ✅ Work with both legacy API (`/orchestrators/api/create/`) and V2 API (`/api/orchestrator/schedule/`)

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Dashboard now works as expected by default
- **Database**: Shifts are properly created and saved when orchestrator runs
- **Backward Compatibility**: Users can still use preview mode by checking the checkbox
- **API Behavior**: More intuitive defaults that match user expectations

The dashboard orchestrator should now create actual shifts in the database when run without the "Preview Only" option selected.
