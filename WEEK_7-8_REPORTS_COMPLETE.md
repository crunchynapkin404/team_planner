## üìà Technical Metrics

### Code Statistics
- **Backend Lines:** ~700 lines (services + API + config)
- **Frontend Lines:** ~970 lines (service + component)
- **Total New Files:** 7 files
- **Modified Files:** 3 files
- **API Endpoints:** 6 new endpoints
- **Report Types:** 6 comprehensive reports

### Performance Considerations
