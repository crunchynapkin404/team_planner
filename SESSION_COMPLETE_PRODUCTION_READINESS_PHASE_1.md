**Usage:**
```bash
# Set environment variables first
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="config.settings.production"

# Run audit
python3 security_audit.py

# Check exit code
echo $?  # 0 = pass, 1 = critical issues found
```

### Production Configuration

**Key Settings Documented:**

```python
# Security
DEBUG = False
SECRET_KEY = env('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000

# Performance
DATABASES['default']['CONN_MAX_AGE'] = 600
CACHES = {'default': {'BACKEND': 'django_redis...'}}

# Monitoring
LOGGING = {...}  # Structured logging
```

### Deployment Architecture
