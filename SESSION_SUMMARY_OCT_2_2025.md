## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Permission-Based Access
All report endpoints require one of:
- `can_run_orchestrator` (Shift Planners)
- `can_manage_team` (Managers)
- `is_superuser` (Administrators)

### Who Can Access Reports:
- ✅ Administrators (all permissions)
- ✅ Managers  
- ✅ Shift Planners
- ❌ Regular Employees
- ❌ Read-Only Users

### Security Response:
- Unauthorized: `403 Forbidden`
- Unauthenticated: `401 Unauthorized`

---

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- ✅ Query optimization with `select_related()`
- ✅ Prefetch related objects with `prefetch_related()`
- ✅ Filter early, aggregate late
- ✅ No N+1 query problems

### Performance Characteristics
- **Query Complexity:** O(n) where n = employees or shifts
- **Response Time:** Expected < 1 second for typical datasets
- **Caching:** Not implemented (future enhancement)
- **Pagination:** Not implemented (future enhancement)

### Database Impact
- **New Tables:** 0 (uses existing models)
- **New Migrations:** 0 (zero schema changes)
- **Query Type:** Read-only (SELECT queries only)
