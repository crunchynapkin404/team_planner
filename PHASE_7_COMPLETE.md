- Account information sidebar with employment details
- Team membership display
- Role-based UI adjustments

### 4. ✅ Navigation and Routing Integration
**Updated Files**: 
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added routes for new pages
- `frontend/src/components/layout/SideNavigation.tsx` - Updated navigation menu

**Navigation Enhancements**:
- Added "User Management" navigation item with People icon
- Added "Team Management" navigation item with Groups icon  
- Added "Profile" navigation item with AccountCircle icon
- Organized navigation with logical grouping and dividers
- Updated route handling for `/employees`, `/user-management`, `/team-management`, `/teams`, and `/profile`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Components**: Implemented as functional components with TypeScript
- **Material-UI Integration**: Comprehensive use of MUI components for consistent design
- **State Management**: Local state with useState hooks for form management
- **API Integration**: Fetch-based HTTP client with token authentication
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with user feedback

### User Interface Design
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive design for different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information organization with cards and tables
- **Action Grouping**: Logical placement of buttons and controls
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded chips and badges for quick status recognition

### Data Integration
- **API Endpoints**: Assumes backend API endpoints for user, team, and profile management
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication with localStorage
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic data refresh after operations

## API Requirements
The following API endpoints are expected by the frontend implementation:

### User Management
- `GET /api/users/` - List all users
- `POST /api/users/` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/{id}/` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}/` - Delete user

### Team Management  
- `GET /api/teams/` - List all teams
- `POST /api/teams/` - Create new team
- `PUT /api/teams/{id}/` - Update team
- `DELETE /api/teams/{id}/` - Delete team
- `GET /api/departments/` - List departments
- `DELETE /api/teams/{id}/members/{member_id}/` - Remove team member

### Profile Management
- `GET /api/profile/` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/profile/` - Update profile
- `GET /api/profile/notifications/` - Get notification settings
- `PUT /api/profile/notifications/` - Update notification settings
- `POST /api/profile/change-password/` - Change password

## Phase 7 Success Metrics

### ✅ Permission System
- Role-based UI components implemented in all management interfaces
- Multi-role support with admin, manager, and member distinctions
- Permission inheritance through team-based role assignments

### ✅ User Interface
- Complete profile management with personal information editing
- Availability toggle controls for weekends and incident work
- Team assignment interface with role specification
- Role management interface (accessible to admin users)

### ✅ Team Management
- Team creation and editing with department organization
- Member assignment with role-based permissions
- Team-based reporting through statistics display
- Team Lead permissions through manager assignment

## Integration Points

### Backend Dependencies
- Django user model integration
- Employee model with extended profile fields
- Team and department models
- Permission/role system in Django
- API authentication middleware

### Frontend Dependencies
- React Router for navigation
- Material-UI for component library
- TypeScript for type safety
- Local storage for authentication token management

## Next Phase Preparation
Phase 7 establishes the foundation for Phase 8 (Testing & Polish) by providing:
- Complete user management workflows for testing
- Role-based access control for feature testing
- Team management capabilities for integration testing
- Profile management for end-to-end user testing

## Known Considerations
1. **Backend API Implementation**: Frontend assumes API endpoints exist; backend implementation may be required
2. **File Upload**: Profile photo upload is implemented as placeholder; requires backend file handling
3. **Real-time Updates**: Current implementation uses polling; WebSocket integration could enhance user experience
4. **Permission Enforcement**: Frontend implements role-based UI; backend must enforce permissions at API level
5. **Bulk Operations**: User management supports bulk actions; backend endpoints may need batch operation support

**Phase 7 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Next Phase**: Phase 8 - Testing & Polish
**Ready for**: Backend API verification and testing implementation
