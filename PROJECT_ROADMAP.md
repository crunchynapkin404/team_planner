## 🚀 Current Phase: Week 5-6 (Next Steps)

### Priority 1: Backend Permission Enforcement ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completed:** October 1, 2025  
**Time Spent:** Already implemented in prior work

**Implementation Summary:**
The backend permission system was already fully implemented and tested. All critical API endpoints are secured with RBAC permission checks.

**Protected ViewSets:**
1. ✅ UserViewSet - `@require_permission('can_manage_users')`
2. ✅ TeamViewSet - `@require_permission('can_manage_team')`
3. ✅ DepartmentViewSet - `@require_permission('can_manage_team')`
4. ✅ LeaveRequestViewSet - `@require_permission('can_request_leave')` / `can_approve_leave`
5. ✅ OrchestratorViewSet - `@require_permission('can_run_orchestrator')`
6. ✅ SwapRequestViewSet - Permission checks implemented

**Permission Decorators:**
- ✅ `@require_permission(permission_name)` - Single permission check
- ✅ `@require_any_permission(*names)` - OR logic for multiple permissions
- ✅ `@require_all_permissions(*names)` - AND logic for multiple permissions
- ✅ Returns 401 for unauthenticated, 403 for unauthorized

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ 16/16 permission tests passed (100%)
- ✅ Unauthorized users receive 403 Forbidden responses
- ✅ Authorized users can access permitted resources
- ✅ Superusers bypass permission checks correctly
- ✅ Test credentials created for all 5 roles

**Documentation:**
- ✅ BACKEND_PERMISSIONS_COMPLETE.md (348 lines)
- ✅ PERMISSION_TESTING_RESULTS.md (214 lines)
- ✅ test_permissions.sh automated testing script

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All API endpoints check permissions
- ✅ 403 errors returned for unauthorized access
- ✅ Read-Only users cannot modify any data
- ✅ Employees can only view their own schedule
- ✅ Managers can approve requests
- ✅ Integration tests passing

---
