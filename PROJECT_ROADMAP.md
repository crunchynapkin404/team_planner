# Team Planner - Project Roadmap

## Questions for Clarification

Before documenting the complete roadmap, I need clarification on several key aspects:

### 1. Shift Types & Orchestrator Details

**Incidents (Automatic Scheduling):**
- **Type**: IT/Technical incidents
- **Schedule**: Monday-Friday, 8:00-17:00 (business hours only)
- **Duration**: Full week assignments (same engineer Mo-Fri)
- **Coverage**: 1 engineer per shift
- **Skill Requirement**: Only engineers with "incident" skill
- **Planning Horizon**: 52 weeks (full year planning)
- **Availability**: All engineers fully available except holidays and approved leave
- **Leave Handling**: Engineers must swap shifts with colleagues if they need leave during their assigned week
- **Fairness**: Equal distribution of incident weeks across all qualified engineers over the entire year

**Waakdienst (Automatic Scheduling):**
- **Type**: On-call/Standby duty (complementary to Incidents)
- **Schedule**: 
  - **Weekdays**: 17:00-08:00 next day (when Incidents shift is off)
  - **Weekends**: Full 24 hours (Saturday & Sunday)
- **Duration**: Full week assignments (same engineer Wednesday 17:00 to next Wednesday 08:00)
- **Coverage**: 1 engineer per shift
- **Relationship to Incidents**: Covers all hours when Incident shift is NOT active
- **Planning**: Same rules as Incidents (52-week planning, equal distribution, swap system)

**Orchestrator Considerations:**
- Generate both Incident and Waakdienst schedules seperately
- Ensure no engineer has both Incident and Waakdienst in the same week
- Fair distribution across both shift types combined

**Changes & Projects (Manual Scheduling):**
- **Type**: Regular daily work assignments (default when not on Incidents)
- **Schedule**: Business hours (08:00-17:00) Monday-Friday
- **Assignment Logic**: Automatic fallback - any engineer NOT assigned to Incidents will work on Changes & Projects
- **Management**: Team Leads/Planners manually assign specific projects/changes to available engineers
- **Duration**: Flexible based on project/change requirements

### 2. Time Tracking & Fairness

**Time Tracking Requirements:**
- Track actual days worked for each shift type
- Separate calculations for Incidents vs Waakdienst
- Daily granularity for precise fairness tracking

**Fairness Calculation:**
- **Incidents**: Count total days assigned to Incident shifts (5 days per week)
- **Waakdienst**: Count total days assigned to Waakdienst shifts (7 days per week)
- **Independent Tracking**: Incident fairness and Waakdienst fairness calculated separately
- **Distribution Period**: Per year fairness (equal distribution within the selected planning period)
- **Manual Planning**: Planner can manually trigger orchestrator and select custom planning periods

### 3. User Roles & Permissions

**User (Base Level):**
- View their own schedule
- Request shift swaps with other users
- Approve incoming swap requests directed to them
- Request leave
- View team calendar (read-only)

**Team Lead:**
- All User permissions
- Approve shift swaps for their team members
- Approve leave requests for their team
- Assign Projects & Changes to available team members
- Run orchestrator for planning periods
- View team schedules and reports
- Manage team composition and member assignments

**Admin:**
- All permissions (full system access)
- User management (create, edit, deactivate users)
- System configuration
- Cross-team operations
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Audit logs access

**Role System:**
- Users can have multiple roles (e.g., User + Team Lead + Admin)
- Planner role may be merged with Team Lead (to be determined during development)

### 4. Calendar & Frontend Requirements

**Calendar Views:**
- **Month View**: Traditional monthly calendar grid
- **Week View**: Detailed weekly schedule view
- **Year View**: Overview of entire year for long-term planning
- **Timeline View**: Gantt-style timeline for detailed scheduling

**Calendar Functionality:**
- **Drag & Drop**: Move shifts between dates and engineers
- **Smart Swap Requests**: When dragging to another engineer, automatically trigger swap request dialog
- **Visual Clarity**: Easy identification of who has which shift assignment
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for each shift type (Incidents, Waakdienst, Changes, Projects)
- **Conflict Prevention**: System prevents overlapping shift assignments
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates when changes are made

**Display Requirements:**
- Clear engineer names on shift blocks
- Shift type identification
- Time ranges visible
- Status indicators (confirmed, pending, swap requested)

### 5. Technical Preferences

**Frontend Technology Stack:**
- **Framework**: React with Vite (fast build, modern tooling, cookiecutter compatible)
- **Calendar Library**: FullCalendar.js (most feature-rich, excellent drag-drop, multiple views)
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) - comprehensive components, professional look
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (predictable state, great dev tools, scales well)
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with React Query (caching, background updates, error handling)

**Integration with Django:**
- **API**: Django REST Framework with proper CORS setup
- **Authentication**: Token-based auth integrated with Django's user system
- **WebSockets**: Django Channels for real-time calendar updates
- **Build Integration**: Serve React build from Django static files

**Key Libraries for Requirements:**
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit (modern, accessible, works well with FullCalendar)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Yup validation
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast for user feedback
- **Icons**: Material Icons (consistent with MUI)

### 6. Business Logic & Organizational Structure

**Skills System:**
- Simple toggle on user profile: "Available for Incidents" (Yes/No)
- Simple toggle on user profile: "Available for Waakdienst" (Yes/No)
- Orchestrator only includes users with relevant toggles enabled

**Team Structure:**
- One team per engineer (single team membership)
- Multiple engineers per team
- Team-based permissions and reporting

**Leave Request Workflow:**
1. Engineer requests leave during assigned shift period
2. System shows popup: "You have shifts assigned during this period that need reassignment"
3. System automatically suggests available engineers for swapping
4. Engineer creates swap requests to suggested engineers
5. Target engineers receive swap requests and can accept/decline
6. Once swap is accepted, leave request becomes available for approval
7. Team Lead approves the leave request
8. **Leave is blocked until swap is fully arranged and approved**

**Shift Reassignment Process:**
- System finds engineers with matching availability toggles
- Suggests engineers who are available during the requested period
- Engineers must explicitly accept swap requests
- No automatic reassignment without explicit consent

**Company Holidays:**
- Ignored for initial implementation (can be added later)
