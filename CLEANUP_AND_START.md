## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Week 5 - Backend Permission Enforcement

### Why This Matters
Frontend currently hides features based on permissions, but API endpoints are completely open. This is a **security vulnerability** - anyone with API access can bypass UI restrictions.

### What We're Building
A permission enforcement system that:
1. Checks permissions before executing any API operation
2. Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized requests
3. Works seamlessly with existing RBAC system
4. Applies to all endpoints (shifts, swaps, leaves, orchestrator, teams, users)

---

## ðŸš€ Let's Start Building!

### Step 1: Create Permission Decorator

**File:** `team_planner/rbac/decorators.py`

This decorator will:
- Check if user is authenticated
- Use RBACService to verify permission
- Return 403 if unauthorized
- Allow request to proceed if authorized

### Step 2: Apply to All ViewSets

We'll systematically apply permissions to:
- ShiftViewSet (view, create, edit, delete)
- SwapRequestViewSet (request, approve, reject)
- LeaveRequestViewSet (request, approve, reject)
- OrchestratorViewSet (run)
- TeamViewSet (manage teams)
- UserViewSet (manage users)
- DepartmentViewSet (manage departments)

### Step 3: Test with All Roles

Verify that:
- Super Admin: Can do everything
- Manager: Can approve requests and view reports
- Shift Planner: Can create shifts and run orchestrator
- Employee: Can view and request
- Read-Only: Can only view

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist

### Backend Permission Enforcement
- [ ] Create `team_planner/rbac/decorators.py` with `@require_permission` decorator
- [ ] Apply to ShiftViewSet (4 permissions)
- [ ] Apply to SwapRequestViewSet (3 permissions)
- [ ] Apply to LeaveRequestViewSet (3 permissions)
- [ ] Apply to OrchestratorViewSet (2 permissions)
- [ ] Apply to TeamViewSet (1 permission)
- [ ] Apply to UserViewSet (1 permission)
- [ ] Apply to DepartmentViewSet (1 permission)
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Test with all 5 user roles
- [ ] Document permission requirements in API docs

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Security)
